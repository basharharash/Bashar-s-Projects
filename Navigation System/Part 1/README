Running instruction:
	1-	open the terminal and make sure you are located in the same directory as the files mentioned above.
	2-	Type into the terminal "make server", this will compile and link the needed file
	3-	to compute the total number of waypoints run the excutable file server using the command:
		./server, then you will be prompted to stdin, then the user must provide a valid input line
		that starts with 'R' and will the 'R' will be followed by latitude and longitude coordinates
		values, then the user need to respond with 'A' as a valid request for the server to continue
		, the sever will stop once there are no more waypoints. Alternatively, if the user has the input 
		stored in a txt file the following command can be used to run the server:
		"./server < test-input.txt > mysol.txt" assuming test-input.txt is in the same directory 
		as the files mentioned above
	4-	use the command make claen once done.


Notes and assuptions:
	- if the user failed to follow step 1-4 properly the program will not work as intended
	- you can only pass input files that has similar format to the edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt file
	  since the program is coded based on that.
	-  When there is no path from the start to the end vertex nearest to the start and end points
	   the server will print:
	   N 0
	   E
	   and end the session.
